# Decision Tree Regressor ðŸŒ³ x Lossy Compression Algorithm ðŸ§³

This is an attempt at making a **Decision Tree Regressor** into a **Lossy Compression Algorithm for images**. The plan was to train the regressor on the target image and save a file with the model memory, which is theoretically smaller to store than the target image. Then, to retrive the data, the model would predict the color of a pixel based on its position.
